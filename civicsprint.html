									<h2>Who is Stacey Kirby?</h2>
									<p>"Kirby is a queer, white-bodied, self-appointed civil servant from North Carolina who creates socially-engaged interactive performance art. Her performative interactions set within site-specific installations utilize bureaucratic forms, postures and language in vintage office environments to engage participants and community performers in questions around civil authority. Through humor and satire, Kirby reinvents the bureaucratic process in alternative, private and public spaces to elicit diverse dialogue about identity, community and human rights in the United States. Developed over the past 20 years, in more than 200 performances, with over 300 community performers and 10,000 participants, Kirby’s work evolves with the physical and historical setting, political climate and participants’ involvement at each location." (Stacy L. Kirby)</p>

									<h2>Stacey's Work: "The Power of the Ballot"</h2>
									<p>“Stacey L. Kirby’s The Power of the Ballot, explores the ultimate form of participation in our government - voting. Kirby advocates for political awareness and participation through voting in response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s gutting of the Voting Rights Act of 1964 (2012) and subsequent nation-wide state legislation limiting citizens’ rights.</p>
									<p>The Power of the Ballot establishes a site-specific voting precinct constructed of customized ballot boxes and a woven green privacy curtain, reminiscent of large mechanical lever voting machines. Kirby’s original ballot design and installation reference her own childhood memories and extensive archival research into the evolution of the voting process.</p>
									<p>At the precinct, the Chief Precinct Officer and the Precinct Officer of the Interior assist the voters in casting their ballots. Voters answer the question: What obstacles do you overcome to vote? All ballots cast in ‘the election’ are tallied by community volunteers and a 'winning obstacle' is announced after the precinct closes at the end of the event or exhibition.” (Stacey L. Kirby)</p>
